## About

[Pluggy](https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as per docs:

- pluggy is the crystallized core of plugin management and hook calling for pytest. It enables 1400+ plugins to extend and customize pytest’s default behaviour. Even pytest itself is composed as a set of pluggy plugins which are invoked in sequence according to a well defined set of protocols.

- It gives users the ability to extend or modify the behaviour of a host program by installing a plugin for that program. The plugin code will run as part of normal program execution, changing or enhancing certain aspects of it.

- In essence, pluggy enables function hooking so you can build “pluggable” systems.

I have uploaded a video and repo where I have encoded the 'complete example' in the docs and added a second plugin so that the host can be run with two plugins extending its functionality.
