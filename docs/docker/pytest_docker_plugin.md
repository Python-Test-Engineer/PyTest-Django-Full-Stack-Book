# PyTest and Docker

Docker seems to be an essential part of testing work.

As a result, I have a section on Docker, with a sub section of Docker To Go, a range of ready made Docker set ups. [Docker](https://pytest-cookbook.com/docker/docker_index/)

I have done many trainings on Docker and I would say the best training is on my favourite platform Udemy:
[Docker Bootcamp: Conquer Docker with Real-World Projects](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-bootcamp-conquer-docker-with-real-world-projects)

Sales every two weeks or so will mean you can get if for $20 USD or so. 

What I really like about this course is it does not really go into theory but just builds a great number of microservices and connects them. Repetition makes it become part of the muscle and is probably what is needed for a Test Engineer.

There are other courses that go deeper and one that I find really good is: [Python in Containers](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-in-containers/)


## Docker and PyTest Full Stack

PyTest-Full-Stack has one example using `pytest-docker`.

*Ensure docker desktop or equivalent is running!* ðŸ˜¬ 

Located in tests/docker. My usual folder naming of 70_docker is unacceptable so I just use docker.

There is a YT video of this: [pytest-docker](https://youtu.be/43YKqEg49HI)
